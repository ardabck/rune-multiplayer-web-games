Today we're stoked to announce that we're launching a [$100k grant for open-source web games!](https://github.com/rune/rune-multiplayer-web-games/open-source-grant)

Indie game developers and web devs can now receive a grant to make an open-source multiplayer game using JavaScript / TypeScript. We hope in this way to support indie devs and nurture the open-source web game community.

Rune will award two kinds of grants to indie game devs who make an open-source multiplayer web game:

Spark grants of $500 awarded to promising indie game devs (any background welcome)
Ignite grants of $5000 awarded to devs who've proven themselves with a Spark grant
With these grants, we hope to support indie devs wanting to make awesome games and dramatically boost the ecosystem!


There's two types of grants:
- Spark Grants: $500 for new indie devs.
- Ignite Grants: $5000 for previous Spark awardees.

Awardees get featured on this blog, in the Rune app and on social media. Devs retain full rights.
